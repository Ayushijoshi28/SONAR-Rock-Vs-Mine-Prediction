# SONAR Rock Vs Mine Prediction
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates a machine learning model for predicting whether an object detected by SONAR is a rock or a mine. The model is built using Python and employs various data preprocessing techniques, feature engineering, and a classification algorithm to make predictions.

## Overview
SONAR technology is commonly used to detect underwater objects, and this project focuses on distinguishing between rocks and mines based on SONAR readings. The Jupyter Notebook in this repository provides a step-by-step guide to create, train, and evaluate the prediction model.

## Contents
The repository contains the following key files:

1. SONAR_RockVsMine_prediction.ipynb: This Jupyter Notebook is the main file that contains the code and explanations for the project.
2. sonar.all-data: This dataset is used for training and testing the machine learning model. It contains the SONAR readings and corresponding labels (rock or mine).

# Dependencies
Before running the Jupyter Notebook, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

a. Python (>= 3.x)

b. Jupyter Notebook

c. NumPy

d. Pandas

e. Matplotlib

f. Seaborn

g. Scikit-learn


You can install the required packages using pip:
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

# Running the Notebook
To run the Jupyter Notebook locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/Ayushijoshi28/SONAR-Rock-Vs-Mine-Prediction.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

cd SONAR-Rock-Vs-Mine-Prediction

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook

3.1 Open the SONAR_RockVsMine_prediction.ipynb file in the Jupyter Notebook interface.

3.2 Follow the instructions provided in the Notebook to execute the code cells and see the results.

# How the Model Works
The Jupyter Notebook walks you through the entire process of building the SONAR rock vs. mine prediction model. It covers the following steps:

1. Data Loading: The SONAR dataset is loaded and examined to understand its structure.
2. Data Preprocessing: The data is cleaned, and any missing values are handled appropriately.
3. Data Visualization: The dataset is visualized using plots and graphs to gain insights into the data distribution.
4. Feature Engineering: Relevant features are selected, and feature engineering techniques may be applied to improve model performance.
5. Model Building: The data is split into training and testing sets. A machine learning classification algorithm (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.) is selected, and the model is trained on the training data.
6. Model Evaluation: The trained model's performance is evaluated using various metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc.
7. Predictions: The model is used to make predictions on new data.
